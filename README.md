## Arduino rocket flight computer
My old project (2019)

Arduino using MPU-6050 gyro, controls 4 servos with steering fins to keep stable and guide the rocket straight. Also controls the ignition and parachute deployment.

Pretty bad code, in the future gonna rework (no) it and add barometer to measure altitude.
