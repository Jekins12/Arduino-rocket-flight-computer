# Arduino rocket flight computer
### My old project (2019) and old version (can't find newer)

Arduino using MPU-6050 gyro, controls 4 servos with steering fins to keep stable and guide the rocket straight. Also controls the ignition and parachute deployment.

Pretty bad code, in the future gonna rework it (no) and add barometer to measure barometric altitude.
